        <h2 class="hed-text" >Population  </h2>
        <p class="hed-text1">Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs,
           each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan,
            the Bronx, and Staten Island—were created when local
             governments were consolidated into a single city
             in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute
              the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United
              States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New
               York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the
               world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million 
               residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born
                population of any city in the world as
                 of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area
                  is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion.
                   If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy
           in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.
